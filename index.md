I am a highly motivated **Cloud & Solutions Architect** specializing in the design, implementation, and optimization of **secure AWS solutions**. I drive business value by leveraging Infrastructure as Code, robust DevOps pipelines, and containerized environments.

My core focus areas and proven results include:

* **Cost Optimization** — Achieved documented **35–60% savings** on AWS workloads through architectural right-sizing and serverless design.
* **Security-First Architecture** — Implementing IAM policies, VPC segmentation, and encryption best practices from initial design.
* **CI/CD Automation** — Building reliable and fast release cycles using GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline.
* **Containerization** — Utilizing Docker, ECS, and Kubernetes for resilient and scalable microservices.

I am open to remote-first roles across North America, Europe, and global teams that value technical precision and a growth mindset.
