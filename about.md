# 🚀 Samuel Nartey: Cloud & DevOps Engineer

I am a highly motivated **Cloud & Solutions Architect** specializing in secure, cost-optimized, and scalable infrastructure on AWS and OCI. I leverage a **DevOps mindset** and **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** to automate deployments and accelerate the software delivery lifecycle.

My approach is focused on delivering measurable business impact:

* **Automation:** Proven ability to build fully automated CI/CD pipelines (CodePipeline, GitHub Actions), reducing deployment friction and improving release velocity.
* **Cost Optimization:** Experience with serverless architectures (ECS Fargate) and resource optimization to drive significant cloud cost savings.
* **Architecture:** Skilled in designing and implementing secure multi-tier VPC architectures and cloud-native microservices.
