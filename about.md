## About Me

I’m a Cloud & Solutions Architect with hands-on experience designing scalable, secure, and cost-optimized cloud infrastructures on AWS. My core strengths include Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), CI/CD automation, containerized deployments using Docker and Kubernetes, and cloud-native architecture patterns.

I specialize in building real-world solutions that align with business goals — from multi-tier VPC architectures to microservices on ECS Fargate. My approach emphasizes automation, reusability, and performance, making me a strong fit for globally distributed teams seeking cloud talent with a DevOps mindset.

### 🔧 Technical Skills

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, Lambda, CloudFormation)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform, CloudFormation
- **Containerization & Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECS/EKS
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
- **Monitoring & Cost Optimization**: CloudWatch, AWS Budgets, Trusted Advisor
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

### 📜 Certifications

- ✅ AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate *(in progress or completed)*  
- ✅ HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate  
- *(Include any relevant training or courses, e.g., "AWS Cloud Practitioner – Completed via freeCodeCamp")*

### 🌍 What I’m Looking For

I’m seeking **entry-level or junior cloud engineering / solutions architect roles** where I can contribute to production-grade cloud infrastructure, collaborate across teams, and keep growing in modern DevOps and cloud-native architecture.

I'm open to **remote-first**, **international**, and **junior-level opportunities** — and I bring not just technical skills, but a builder’s mindset, strong documentation practices, and a bias for shipping clean, secure solutions.
