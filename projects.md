# 💻 Featured Projects

This section highlights my hands-on work in cloud automation and DevOps, demonstrating my ability to implement reliable and scalable infrastructure solutions.

## Project 1: **Fully Automated CI/CD on AWS using ECS & ECR**

> **Technologies:** AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, AWS ECS Fargate, AWS ECR, Docker, IAM, YAML.

This project established a robust, end-to-end Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipeline on AWS. The solution automates the entire software release process from source code commit through to deployment on a scalable, serverless containerized environment (ECS Fargate), ensuring rapid and reliable application updates.
